# HW-Module1

## Description

This exercise was completed in order to practice writing code in html and css. Was able to use semantic html elements and commenting in css file to make the source code more aligned with accessibility standards. I learned that writing code is fun!

## Installation

Pull from github repository (it's public) and clone on your local machine to create a directory that allows you to run the code yourself!
